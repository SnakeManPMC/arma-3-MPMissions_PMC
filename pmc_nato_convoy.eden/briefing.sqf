Ground team must reach <marker name = 'meet'>Saint Pierre</marker> and pickup resistance member, then return to the <marker name = 'air'>airbase</marker> in north.<br/><br/>PMC NATO Convoy<br/><br/>GEN SITREP<br/>Everon is under Russian control except the airbase where NATO HQ is located. We must evacuate the last remaining resistance member from this island, he helds key information about Russian plans and is vital for our war effort. It is essential that we get him back alive as soon as possible.<br/><br/>INTEL<br/>Enemy has several armored vehicles patrolling the Everon, small number of infantry also. Saint Pierre and airbase are clear of enemy activity.<br/><br/>ORDERS<br/>Ground team <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> from the lot in a 5t truck. Air team is put together from A-10 tank killer and 2 AH-64 Apache gunships, they start from the <marker name = 'air'>airbase</marker> in north. Mission objective is to pickup single resistance member from <marker name = 'meet'>Saint Pierre</marker> and bring him back to NATO controlled territory in the <marker name = 'air'>airbase</marker> at north.<br/><br/>TACTICAL<br/>The 5t truck will be wasted instantly if the air team does not clear the path first, make no mistake, even if you dont yet see the enemy tanks, they will see you believe me. Let the air team make the enemy vehicles suffer before entering deep into enemy territory. Ground team must stay lookout for enemy infantry too, a RPG wont be a good thing for that truck either."]];
