Stay alive and help out our NATO allies by killing ruskies!<br/><br/>Conflict<br/><br/>GEN SITREP<br/>NATO and Russians are fighting over this island for quite some time now. They both control about half of the island where Montignac is the hot spot at the moment, both forces are bringing new supplies by large transport boats; NATO to the north near the airbase and Russians to the south near the Sainte Pierre city.<br/><br/>INTEL<br/>We have no intel available. NATO guys havent got any fancy radios for us yet so we dont have link up for their nice intel. Only thing we know is that Russian armor uses the road coming into Montignac from south. Lot of armor and helicopter activity in the past few days.<br/><br/>ORDERS<br/>Our current orders are to assist NATO forces by doing any damage we can for the Russian forces in the island. It most likely would be shooting down Russian helicopters and laying mines in the road south from Montignac etc. If possible it would also be good to snipe out some Russian officers. Your support is the ammo boxes in <marker name = 'ammo'>Ammo Depot</marker> and in your <marker name = 'start'>start</marker> location, make them useful.<br/><br/>TACTICAL<br/>We have pretty much stick and stones agains the Russian ground and air forces. So we must be like sneaky bastards when we move in the battlefield. Hit and Run, no heroics. Stinger missiles have good reach from that location and even careful RPG shots could do some damage to the armor. Snipers could be carefully placed little closer to the Montignac to eliminate Officers or other high value targets.<br/>Good luck Rebel!"]];
