# arma-3-MPMissions_PMC

ArmA 3 all PMC terrain and CUP multiplayer missions, these use CUP units, vehicles and weapons.

PMC terrains are PMC 51km Desert, PMC Rattler, PMC Rugen and Ulah-Yuryakh.

See [CUP download](http://cup-arma3.org/download) and [PMC Tactical ArmA 3](https://www.pmctactical.org/arma3/index.php)

I don't like having several campaigns / missions in one big blob repo, but its also crazy to have 100's of single mission dirs in github root.
