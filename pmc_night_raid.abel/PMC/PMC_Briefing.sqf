Mission is accomplished when all Russian infantry plus equipment is destroyed.<br/><br/>It would be stupid to think Russians don't have patrols in the area, so watch out for them. Place Satchel Charges under the vehicles you want to destroy. Don't worry about nuking half the city, you're authorized to use any force necessary to get the job done."]];
